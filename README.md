Trade Tracker is currently early in the development cycle. This app is not yet functional but is being actively developed. Please "watch" the project and leave a star to get all updates.


## Description
Trade Tracker is a next generation stock journal and analysis tool that allows you to review and improve your trades in financial markets. Trade Tracker was built to empower individual retail traders to gain personal insights on trading psychology, discipline, and trends that help them become consistent. 

## Features

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `marketing`: [Trade Tracker](https://tradetracker.ai/) landing page
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://app.tradetracker.ai/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
npm run dev
```

To run individual app:
```npm run web``` - web workspace on port 3000
```npm run marketing``` - marketing workspace on port 3001

scrip is short for specific workspace ```npm run dev -w=web ```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
